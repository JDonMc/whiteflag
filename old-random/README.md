The Arc Length Calculus Equation used in the AI and Fourier Transform is actually copyrighted by me and can be found here: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328293415_Non-Linear_Arc_Length_Calculus which means if you want to use this state of the art stuff you'll need my permission and I'll need full disclosure, and if it's for commercial use we'll need to sign an agreement and I'll need to take a cut, but it'll be less than the performance boost you see.
